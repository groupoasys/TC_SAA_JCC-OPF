# Tight and Compact Model of the SAA-based Joint Chance-constrained OPF üöÄ

## Goals üñºÔ∏è

The aim of this repository is to provide the details of the power systems data set and code used in paper [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03370). This article have been developed by some members of the [OASYS group](https://sites.google.com/view/groupoasys/home) thanks to the funding of the project [Flexanalytics](https://groupoasysflexanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We suggest you to visit the related links to know more our research üòâ

## Contents üåå

This repository includes the main code and data of the work in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03370). The data is extracted from a [repository of power grids](https://github.com/power-grid-lib/pglib-opf).

In the next links, you can find data related to generators, lines and loads of the different power systems used in this work, where each file is in ".csv" format.
